# Page Draw & Doodle

Page Draw & Doodle transforms any webpage into an interactive canvas to draw and annotate on.

## Features

* **Persistent Doodles** All your drawings are saved per URL and reload automatically whenever you revisit.

Designed for power users and casual doodlers alike, Page Draw & Doodle blends into your browsing experience with no page reloads, no complicated settings, just a lightweight, always-available canvas on top of any web page.
